**UERANSIM** <small>(pronounced "ju-i ræn sɪm")</small>, is the open-source state-of-the-art 5G UE and RAN (gNodeB) implementation. The project can be used for testing 5G Core Network and studying 5G System.

## Current Status
Our UE and gNodeB are functional and ready to use. You can connect them to your 5G core network right now and start using it. 

In terms of 3GPP coverage, fundamental control plane features are done. However, some of them are in progress.

At the same time, 5G-NR radio interface is under development but not complete yet. Currently we utilize the radio interface over a simulated environment.

## Documentation
You can find the documentation on [UERANSIM Wiki](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/wiki).

And, since the project is rapidly developing, please make sure that you have always the [latest](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/releases) UERANSIM.  

## Contributing

Implementing UE and RAN is not an easy task and requires a lot of time. We are always open to public contributions and pull requests.

## Supporting

UERANSIM is the first and currently only open source project that implements 5G-SA UE and RAN. Commercial alternatives of this software cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can support this free and open source software by:
- Starring our GitHub repository,
- Creating pull requests, submitting bugs, suggesting new features or documentation updates.
