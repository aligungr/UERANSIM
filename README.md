**UERANSIM** <small>(pronounced "ju-i ræn sɪm")</small>, is the open source state-of-the-art 5G UE and RAN (gNodeB)
simulator. UE and RAN can be considered as a 5G mobile phone and a base station in basic terms. The project can be used for
testing 5G Core Network and studying 5G System.

UERANSIM introduces the world's first and only open source 5G-SA UE and gNodeB implementation.

**WARNING:** I'm no longer active in the development of UERANSIM. However community contributions are welcomed.

## Current Status

Basic functionalities of UE and gNodeB are fully functional and ready to use. However some of the features are not complete.
More details can be found at [Feature Set](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/wiki/Feature-Set).

On the other hand, UERANSIM does not fully provide physical layer. 5G-NR radio interface is partially implemented, and simply simulated over UDP protocol.
